# local-action

> An example of a custom, unpublished, local GitHub Action running within a project repository.

## Usage

A local action still needs to look and behave like a published, GitHub Marketplace action, meaning it still needs to:

-   Contain an `action.yml`
-   Manage it's own dependencies
-   Manage it's own build process
